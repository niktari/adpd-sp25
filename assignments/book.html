        Choose a piece of text to work with and typeset it as a multipage website. Consider how you can take advantage of the dynamic and non-linear potential of the web to create a compelling new experience for the reader.
    </p>

    <p class="space--after-single">Limit the source text you choose to about 2-5 pages. If you’re unsure what piece of text to use, you’re welcome to take a look at any of the below resources:</p>

    <h3>The requirements of this project are below:</h3>
    <div class="todolist">
        <ol class="space--after-triple">
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>Since this is a typographic assignment, you may only use text. No images!</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The website must have at least five pages, each presenting a different section of the text.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The website should be designed using HTML and CSS.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The design should evoke or challenge the themes and spirit of the text.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>Bonus: Incorporate relative units (e.g., <span class="code text--color-green">%</span>, <span class="code text--color-green">em</span>, <span class="code text--color-green">rem</span>, <span class="code text--color-green">vh</span>, <span class="code text--color-green">vw</span>) to ensure your website is optimized across various screen sizes.</p></li>

            <h3>Part 1: Site Map & Content Organization</h3>
            <p class="space--after-single">Choose an existing piece of text you'd like to work with. It can be a short story, a poem, an essay—anything you'd like to reimagine. Condense it to 2–5 pages if necessary. Using pen and paper, create a site map: a visualization of the structure and navigation of your website. Think about how the author originally intended the text to be read and how you want to retell the story in this new web medium. Additionally, in a text editor of your choice (e.g. Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc.), divide the text into separate pages based on your site map.</p>
            <p>Some questions to consider: What are the themes of the text and why did you choose it? How can your concept reflect or challenge those themes? How will you divide the text across pages? How will users navigate the site? How does the meaning of the text shift when presented in a non-linear format?</p>
        </li>

        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 2: HTML Skeleton</h3>
            <p>Translate your site map into a working website by setting up your code environment and HTML files. Populate each of your HTML files with the respective content based on your site map. Focus on content only. Focus on structure, semantics, and hierarchy. This stage is content-only—don’t worry about styling yet. Remember, no images! This is a type-only assignment.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 3: CSS Styles</h3>
            <p class="space--after-single">Bring a portion of your text in Figma and test at least three different typographic palettes before implementing them in CSS.</p>
            <p class="space--after-single">Choose one typographic palette and apply it to your content using CSS. Begin with basic typographic properties such as <span class="code text--color-green">font-family</span>, <span class="code text--color-green">font size</span>, <span class="code text--color-green">line-height</span>, and <span class="code text--color-green">letter-spacing</span>. Explore additional CSS properties to elevate the design and usability of your website.</p>
            <p>Consider how certain typefaces can influence the legibility and tone of the content. How do you think the author would have intended the text to be read? Does your design enhance or disrupt how it’s read?</p>
        </li>

        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 4: Finalize</h3>
                <p class="space--after-single">Continue to refine your work based on feedback, paying close attention to the typographic system you’re developing. Are you applying consistent styles to your headings, paragraphs, and other levels of text? Ensure your design decisions align with your intended user experience and evoke the themes of the text. Put together a 3-minute presentation for Project 1 that walks us through your design process.</p>
