        A poster is arguably the ultimate designed artifact. A good poster requires good hierarchy. A good poster requires good scaling. A good poster requires a compelling subject. A good poster requires a simple design. A good poster requires an immediately comprehensible subject. Design anything to look like a poster, and you have a good design. Master the poster, and you've (possibly) mastered design.

    <p>Your task is to create an interactive web-based poster for a real or fictional event. Some event examples could include but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul class="space--after-single">
        <li>A concert tour</li>
        <li>A film festival</li>
        <li>An educational lecture or workshop series</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The requirements of this project are below:</h3>
    <div class="todolist">
        <ol class="space--after-triple">
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The poster should include: the title of the event; the date, time, and location of that particular event; additional key information, such as speaker names, if applicable.</li>
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The poster should be designed using HTML and CSS.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The poster should have a layer of interactivity that relates to the themes of the event.</p></li>
        </ol>
    </div>
   

    <ul>
        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 1: Concept & Sketch</h3>
            <p class="space--after-single">Using one HTML file and three different stylesheets, create three completely different versions of your poster to explore initial concepts. Yes, that means you’ll switch between styles by changing the linked stylesheet in your HTML for each version!</p>
            <p>The requirements for each version are below:
                <div class="todolist">
                    <ol class="space--after-single">
                        <li><input type="checkbox"><p>Version 1: Design one within a "poster shape," aka vertical dimensions.</p></li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox"><p>Version 2: Design one that uses the full width and height of the browser and uses only typography.</p></li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox"><p>Version 3: Design one that's ugly. You decide what that entails.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 2: Refinement & Interaction</h3>
            <p class="space--after-single">Based on feedback, choose one stylesheet and push your concept and design in that direction.</p>
            <p class="space--after-single">Add a layer of interactivity to your poster. Consider how the interaction evokes the themes of the event.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
