        A poster is arguably the ultimate designed artifact. A good poster requires good hierarchy. A good poster requires good scaling. A good poster requires a compelling subject. A good poster requires a simple design. A good poster requires an immediately comprehensible subject. Design anything to look like a poster, and you have a good design. Master the poster, and you've (possibly) mastered design.

    <p>Your task is to create a series of three interactive web-based posters for a real or fictional event series. Some event examples could include but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul class="space--after-single">
        <li>A concert tour</li>
        <li>A film festival</li>
        <li>An educational lecture or workshop series</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The requirements of this project are below:</h3>
    <div class="todolist">
        <ol class="space--after-triple">
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>As a series, each poster should have some shared components with the other three. It should look like a series.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>Each poster should include: the title of the event; the date, time, and location of that particular event; additional key information, such as speaker names, if applicable.</li>
            </p>
            </li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The posters should be designed using HTML and CSS.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The posters should have a layer of interactivity that relates to the themes of the event.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>Bonus: Print the posters!</p></li>
        </ol>
    </div>
   

    <ul>
        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 1: Concept & Sketch</h3>
            <p class="space--after-single">Using one HTML file and three different stylesheets, create three completely different versions of your poster to explore initial concepts. Yes, that means you’ll switch between styles by changing the linked stylesheet in your HTML for each version!</p>
            <p>The requirements for each version are below:
                <div class="todolist">
                    <ol class="space--after-single">
                        <li><input type="checkbox"><p>Version 1: Design one within a "poster shape," aka vertical dimensions.</p></li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox"><p>Version 2: Design one that uses the full width and height of the browser and uses only typography.</p></li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox"><p>Version 3: Design one that's ugly. You decide what that entails.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 2: Refinement & Interaction</h3>
            <p class="space--after-single">Based on feedback, choose one stylesheet and create a series of three posters within that direction. You should have three separate HTML files instead of one, each representing a different poster.</p>
            <p class="space--after-single">Though the overarching event should remain consistent across all three posters, the details for each—such as city/locale, date, and time—should vary.</p>
            <p>Add a layer of interactivity to your poster. Consider how the interaction evokes the themes of the event.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 3: Finalize</h3>
            <p class="space--after-single">Based on feedback, finalize your poster series. Ask yourself what's working, what isn't, and what can you do to push your concept even further. Put together a 3-minute presentation for Project 2 that walks us through your design process.</p>
            <p>For extra credit: PRINT THE POSTERS!</p>
