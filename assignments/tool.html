        In this project, you’ll explore the boundaries of what a tool can be when made on the web. Your goal is to create a website that generates infinite iterations based on a set of rules, driven by user input. This could take the form of a practical tool, like a type tester or image generator, or something more abstract and experimental.
    </p>
    <p class="space--after-single">It’s important to test your tool throughout the design process—actively engage with your friends, peers, and other users to gather feedback and improve the experience.</p>

    <h3>The requirements of this project are below:</h3>
    <div class="todolist">
        <ol class="space--after-triple">
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The user should be able to provide an input (e.g., text, selection, button click) and receive a unique output each time.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The tool should be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>Include text that explains the purpose of the tool, how it works, and its intended use.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>Bonus: Make the tool responsive and work across different screen sizes.</p></li>
        </ol>
    </div>
   

    <ul>
        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 1: Concept & Sketch</h3>
            <p class="space--after-single">Using Figma, sketch three distinct ideas for a website that utilizes an input and an output. Determine what the input and output would be. For instance, when the user types something, will text appear? Consider who or what this tool is for. Do you want to make something that is useful, semi-useful or not useful at all?</p>
        </li>

        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 2: Coded Draft</h3>
            <p>Choose one of the three directions and start to bring it into code. Focus on only getting the core functionality of the tool down in this round—no need to worry about the design/styling in this stage. If you are running into major technical issues, this is the time to simplify the idea to make it more achievable within the project scope.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 3: Refinement & Testing</h3>
            <p>Refine your work based on class feedback. Finalize the technical functionality. Start to style up the tool, ensuring it aligns with its purpose and audience. Test the tool with at least three different people. Your testers should give you insight into the usability of your tool. Adjust your design and functionality based on the feedback.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 4: Finalize</h3>
                <p>Based on class feedback, finalize your tool. Put together a 3-minute presentation for Project 3 that walks us through your design process.</p>
