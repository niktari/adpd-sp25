        In this project, you'll explore unconventional ways to visualize time by developing a time-based website. Consider different ways to visualize time: with or without numbers, literally or abstractly. The clock can be for a particular use case or have no specific function.

    <h3>The requirements of this project are below:</h3>
    <div class="todolist">
        <ol class="space--after-triple">
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The clock should incorporate real-time date and time data.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The clock should have a layer of interactivity.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The clock should visualize time in an interesting way.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The clock should be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p></li>
            <li><input type="checkbox"><p>The clock should be responsive and work across different screen sizes.</p></li>
        </ol>
    </div>

            <h3>Part 1: Concept & Sketch</h3>
            <p class="space--after-single">Decide on your clock’s purpose (if any). Does it prompt specific actions, like making a wish at 11:11? Does it visualize daily habits, like watering your plants? Or is it purely abstract?</p>
            <p>Once you’ve determined your clock’s functionality, sketch out 10-15 distinct ideas using pen and paper. Explore far and wide! This is an exercise in pushing yourself creatively. At least one sketch should be purely typographic and one should be purely illustrative. Digitize two of your concepts in Figma to prototype how your clock will work and be interacted with. If your clock has a specific use case, what are the relevant time intervals, and how are they displayed? For instance, what does your clock look like when it’s 11:11? When it’s not 11:11? Sketch both of those instances.</p>

            <h3>Part 2: Coded Draft</h3>
            <p>Develop a coded draft of your clock. Start with the core functionality of visualizing real-time data. Focus on integrating interactivity. If you are running into technical or code issues, this is the time to simplify the idea to make it more achievable within the project scope.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="space--after-triple">
            <h3>Part 3: Finalize</h3>
                <p>Based on class feedback, continue to push your concept and design. Put together a 3-minute presentation for Project 4 that walks us through your design process.</p>
