                <p class="space--after-single">Continue to refine your clock so its functionality is nailed down. Polish any remaining design elements: layout, typography, visual language, etc. See if you can make your clock responsive across different devices (revisit fluid units and media queries)!

                <p class="space--after-single">Develop a presentation for Project 3 that walks us through your process and idea. You will have 3 minutes to present, so think about how you can give us a succinct yet thorough walkthrough of your work. Make sure you cover the following points in your presentation:

                        Clock: Show us your live clock. Walk us through the data you‚Äôre using, and how it‚Äôs driving the form and/or content of your clock. Did you use the <span class="code text--color-orange">map</span> function to help ‚Äúnormalize‚Äù your data? Talk about the design decisions you made, and how they contribute to the concept and functionality of your clock.
